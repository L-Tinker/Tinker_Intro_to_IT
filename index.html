<h4>Personal information</h4>
<p>Hi my name is Liam I am a student at RMIT and I am Australian born and I am culturally rural victorian as I grew up in Bendigo, I speak English as my first and only language although <br>
that is something that I have always wished to change and hope to do so, and in 2020 I completed year 12. Providing an Interesting fact about myself is rather challenging for me as I have <br>
always been me and as a result don’t find myself to interesting and often forget fairly standard things about myself but I do enjoy playing video games mostly those of the 4X and strategy <br> 
genre such as many games by paradox interactive and games belonging to the Total War series as well as others but I do also play a lot of other games from different genres and franchises too.</p>
<h4>Interest in IT</h4>
<p>I have been interested in IT for as long as I can remember as dumb as that may sound. My dad works in Telecommunications and although not too directly related to IT it meant that I growing <br>
up was always around computers, technology, and the internet. My interest in IT is fairly broad and I enjoy various aspects of it particularly programming and design aspects as I can be fairly <br>
creative while being pretty logic driven. I also enjoy working with computers generally although my knowledge on hardware is fairly lacking and I do better when dealing with software and due to my<br>
father I have some knowledge and experience with networks.</p>
<p>Even though I have almost always enjoyed IT I think it started in year 7 when we had a term of a computer class that I have forgotten what was called but it was in that class that I first<br>
started programing to a degree using drag and drop to create fairly basic programs and games and it was in this class that I realized how much I enjoy it. However it was likely year 8 when this <br>
interest really kicked off when picking electives I took year 8 computing which was the continuation of the class from year 7 which is ware I met Mr Vaughan who I remember being fairly cool yet <br>
daggy and encouraged me to continue with the subject and my interest. I don’t have a lot of IT experience I have been programming in some form since year 7 and did a lot of it in years 9 and 10 <br>
but less and 11 and 12 due to subjects and school requirements and in these classes going from years 7 to 10 I did small amounts of other IT related topics but outside of school I did very little <br>
aside from the bits and pieces of stuff I would do with my dad.</p>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT because it is the best school in the state (and possibly the country) for technology and related subjects which IT is. I also really wanted to be in the city and around <br>
where things where happening and with how active and cool RUSU (the student union) it seemed like the perfect fit for me. </p>
<p>I hope to learn a lot from this course and expand my knowledge on the subjects although I doubt I’ll learn anything completely new that I knew nothing of before but mostly just expanding and <br>
broadening my knowledge and skills in the subject. That being said I would love to be pleasantly surprised and discover a previously unknown subject within IT that I knew nothing of beforehand <br>
and I look forward to learning in an interesting environment and am always open to learning new things.</p>
<h4>Personality profile</h4>
<h5>Myers-Briggs</h5>
<p>After having taken the Myers-Briggs test I received the Commander ENTJ-T personality type which description reads “Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody <br>
the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of <br>
rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest <br>
they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take <br>
for granted every day.”</p>
