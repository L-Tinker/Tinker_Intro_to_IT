<h4>Personal information</h4>
<p>Hi my name is Liam I am a student at RMIT and I am Australian born and I am culturally rural victorian as I grew up in Bendigo, I speak English as my first and only language although that is something that I have always wished to change and hope to do so, and in 2020 I completed year 12. Providing an Interesting fact about myself is rather challenging for me as I have always been me and as a result donâ€™t find myself to interesting and often forget fairly standard things about myself but I do enjoy playing video games mostly those of the 4X and strategy genre such as many games by paradox interactive and games belonging to the Total War series as well as others but I do also play a lot of other games from different genres and franchises too.</p>
